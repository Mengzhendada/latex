\section{About Epics}
EPICS is a set of software tools and applications which provide a software infrastructure for use in building distributed control systems to operate devices such as Particle Accelerators, Large Experiments and major Telescopes. Such distributed control system typically comprise tens or even hundreds of computers, networked together to allow communication between them and to provide control and feed back of the various parts of the device from a central control room or even remotely over the internet\cite{epicswebsite}.
